# Bank Management System Project

This is a simple console-based Bank Management System project written in C++. The program allows users to perform various banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, checking balance, viewing all account holders, modifying accounts, and closing accounts.

## Features

- Create a new account with a random account number.
- Support two types of accounts: Savings (S) and Credit (C).
- Set initial deposit limits for each account type.
- Deposit funds into an existing account.
- Withdraw funds from an existing account while enforcing minimum balance rules.
- View individual account details by providing the account number.
- Display a list of all account holders.
- Modify account holder details like name and account type.
- Close an existing account.
- Secure access to account holder list using a bank password.

## How to Use

1. Run the program by compiling and executing the C++ code.
2. Follow the on-screen menu options to perform different banking operations.
3. To create a new account, select option 1 and provide the necessary details.
4. To perform transactions (deposit/withdraw), use options 2 and 3 by providing the account number.
5. Use option 4 to check the balance of a specific account.
6. Option 5 displays the list of all account holders.
7. To modify an account, select option 7 and provide the account number.
8. To close an account, use option 6 by providing the account number.
9. The program will ask for a bank password to view the list of all account holders (option 5).
10. The program will keep running until you choose to exit (option 8).

## Note

- The bank password is hardcoded in the code for simplicity. In real-world applications, it should be stored securely and managed by an authorized personnel.
- This project is intended for educational purposes and may not cover all real-world banking scenarios.
